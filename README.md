<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Text-based adventure games (also known as Interactive Fiction, or IF) are a classic game type in which all interaction is done through the use of on-screen text. Despite their primitive origins born from hardware limitations, this type of adventure is still alive today and enjoyable on modern devices.

The motive behind this project was to learn how make a bare-bones game using Unity. During the course of the project i have gained a good understanding of many of the essential skills required in programming games.
